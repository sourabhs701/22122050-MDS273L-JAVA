Create a java program, that stores the details of a student (Name, Register Number, Email, Class, Department).
You can use a two-dimensional array to store the details.
HINT: String arr[] = {{"Alwin","1847207","alwin@christ.in","MCA","Computer Science"},{"Balagangadhar","2011204","bala@christ.in","MDS","Data Science"}}

You need to have functions to:
Collect the details of the student
Display the details of the student
Search the details of the student
With the help of a menu-driven main function, you need to access these functions inside your class and perform the operations.
